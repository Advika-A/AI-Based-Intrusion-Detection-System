\# AI-Based Intrusion Detection System (AI-IDS)



\## 📌 Overview

This project implements a hybrid AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines supervised learning and anomaly detection to identify both known and unknown network attacks.



\## 🚀 Key Features

\- Random Forest classifier for detecting known attacks

\- Isolation Forest for anomaly and zero-day attack detection

\- Feature importance analysis for explainability

\- Trained on NSL-KDD dataset



\## 🧠 Datasets Used

\- NSL-KDD (baseline intrusion detection dataset)

\- CICIDS2017 (to be integrated for modern attack patterns)



\## 🛠️ Technologies

\- Python

\- Scikit-learn

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Git \& GitHub
